                                Friends and freaks with terrifying keyword searches that ended up on my blog: it was time to say goodbye to content I’d been hauling around for years. That means posts from before 2015 are now in the big blog dumpster in the sky. Scroll down for my latest news.  If you were looking for something else, something potentially revol­ting for which this website was the only known source, I’m afraid you’re plumb out of luck.

                                Despite the protagonist’s odd gift, The City is really a story about a man and a boy who learn to trust each other in a world that’s fallen apart. I owe special thanks to editor Jeff Georgeson at Penumbric Speculative Fiction Magazine for feeling strongly enough about this 8,000-word tale to take a risk on it. It’s been on and off of editors’ desks for years now.

                            I also want to thank Harry Crews for writing a whole novel about a guy who swallows his car. (Don’t listen to Jonathan Yardley. Read it!) This was probably, in some way, the seed of this story.&#32;<a href="http://www.penumbric.com/currentissue/Issue_February2k22.pdf" target="_blank">Read The City now in Speculative Fiction Mag Vol. 5 Issue 5</a>.

                                There’s been a lot of talk about what makes Florida Man more suscep­tible than other American men to committing weird, pointless crimes preserved for posterity by bizarre, frightening mugshots. This song offers a possible answer. (Actually, three possible answers.)

                                The OJ Simpson trial happened a long time ago. It stands out for a number of well documented reasons — none of which appears in this very short piece of flash fiction, which focuses on probably the one detail about OJ that means absolutely nothing to anybody. <a href="https://nauseateddrive.tumblr.com/post/642139542750658560/big-headed-men-by-max-sheridan-i-was/" target="_blank">Read it at Nauseated Drive</a>.

                                It isn’t often that you get to collaborate with two of the greatest living Nic Cage authorities. So when Professor Andy Rogers at Georgia Perimeter College (do you remember the pilot for the Bob Ross biopic that aired on Public Access TV in Hibbing, Minnesota, the one where Ross is dressed in chocolate pudding and uses machetes instead of paint brushes?) and poet/Lord Littlebrook scholar Gregg Murray suggested a piece about Cage’s latest hobbies at Real Pants, I got right on it.

                                The Cage Collection started off as a weird dream. Then it was a literary correspondence. What it eventually became was the first scholarly treatment on freak Nic Cage appearances in paintings and photographs through the ages, including The Thyroidal Breastfeeding Madonna Cage, Nosferatu Cage, and Chicago Nationals legend Joe Tinker Cage.

                                I’ll be at WriterHouse in Charlottesville, Virginia, this August teaching two special workshops on story development. We’re going to have fun experimenting with Kurt Vonnegut’s story shapes, reading some of my favorite stories, like Larry Brown’s Samaritans and Raymond Carver’s Neighbors, and plotting and writing some stories of our own.

                                Good question. But we don’t want to mix that kind of spice with this kind of spice. Let’s just say any novel about telepathic orgasms is bound to be sizzling.

                                Not the kind you’re thinking of. This is an erotic novel and has plenty of “slick members” and “glistening entrances,” but no truly revolting sexual aberrations, except for the final scene, which will make you hate me forever.

                                No.

                                Don’t be coy. Many years ago when I had a job stacking books at a university library, I worked with a guy who did just that. He said it actually woke him up. So, if you’re at work and sneaking in a few pages of smut, please relieve yourself. Just not in the company of your coworkers. Find a quiet corner of the office or a handsome potted plant and indulge your erotic passions in semi-private.

                            <p>

                            You’re a 60-year-old vet and and you left your wife and a solid pension 10 years ago because the ghosts in your head wouldn’t let you be. Life’s simpler when you forget. Work, beer, whisky, sleep.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                Until you end up at the wrong bar on the wrong night and everything you’ve been running from blindsides you like a Greyhound. The next thing you know you’re in a cheap motel room off the Interstate with two grade-A psychopaths using a knife you swore you’d never touch again.

                            <p>
                                Dillo slides onto your bookshelf bloody.<br>
                            <p>
                                It’s not the blood dripping from that supremely pulpy sawed-off finger by Rock the Dog. It’s just that Dillo was kicked around awhile before it found its home at Shotgun Honey, now an imprint of Down and Out Books. And, sure, its author has gone along for the ride.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it got there and for that I have to thank Ron Earl Phillips at Shotgun Honey for deciding to publish it with Eric Campbell and Lance Wright at Down and Out Books.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rock the Dog spent the hottest days of the summer of 2017 working over, I believe, 17 versions of the cover. The work paid off. No matter what you think of the book, the cover will be stuck to the inside of your brainpan until someone scrapes it off with a blowtorch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d like to thank Andy Rogers and Deb Hull, who have been reading my stuff before I was reading my stuff. Seven years ago Andy — then the fiction editor of the Chattahoochee Review — sent me a really nice email out of the blue about a story I’d submitted. The story got rejected, but Andy’s encouragement has kept this boat afloat since then. We’ve even worked together on a script for an absurdist Wall Street shark thriller.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d like to thank Nat Sobel for his generous advice at the beginning of my crime rampage. It helped me get Dillo in the shape it is in now. Todd Robinson at Thuglit helped me early on by publishing two of my first psychopath stories. Tom Pitts has been unbelievably generous since I sent my first piece of flash fiction to Out of the Gutter in 2014, and he’s one of my favorite crime writers. If you haven’t read Hustle, what are you waiting for?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d like to thank Jack Getze for his thoughtful words on Dillo and for his advice on writing. That advice is now taped to the wall of my office. I was lucky enough to have Alec Cizak and Joshua Corin, two more writers I admire, read the MS and write blurbs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Evan Lambert has read the early drafts of every book I’ve ever written, and for that I owe him many beers I can’t buy him, being an ocean and a sea away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, I’d like to thank my wife, Theopisti, for putting up with me since Austin and through all our adventures since.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thanks, baby.

                                It’s been about two years since this piece was accepted, but Richard Peabody’s mammoth two-volume 40th Anniversary Issue has finally hit the press. Peabody has been publishing Gargoyle Magazine since 1976, without hiatus. He’ll finally be taking one this year. I hope the NEA is around when he gets back. Which is a good reason to get your copy of Gargoyle today.

                                Another good reason is that inside you’ll find at least one story dealing with all the following pressing issues: the boulder scene from Effren C. Piñon’s 1983 classic The Killing of Satan, pupu platters and tinnitus, death by scrotal ring explosion, and extended families who disappear inside refrigerator box death traps.&#32;<a href="https://gargoylemagazine.com/65-2/" target="_blank">Get your copy here</a>.

Tiki Bizarro probably doesn’t work to categorize this strange, fluid-gushing book. Not even Shapeshifting Tiki Bizarro Porn Death Trip would prepare you for Freaks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After a shaky opening chapter — there was a lot of information crammed into the first few pages — I couldn’t stop reading, and I’m still not sure why. It wasn’t because I liked the characters. You weren’t supposed to. It wasn’t because the sentences made you gasp.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I guess what it was, was a little like being trapped inside what I’d always imagined my own warped brain might look like. Except Viharo’s brain was leaking out onto the pages. He was actually writing it down. What it was was a liberation. A beautiful, filthy, fucking liberation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After that first chapter, when you’re dropped headfirst into the weirdness, the novella picks up at a reckless pace with the demented plot lines self-propagating seamlessly. The story just gets weirder, and the weirder it gets, the more sense it makes. It glues itself together like all the jizz and blood sticking to the sheets of L’ Hotel du Frisson.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The overall effect is indeed, as the subtitle says, a nightmare. A seedy, self-imploding, funhouse nightmare.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Plus all your old favorites: Mexican porn queens, Chet Baker, Art Pepper, grindhouse flicks, old horror movies, heart-shaped asses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And cock-sucking vampires and weregirls who transform upon orgasm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And don’t forget the Mantis Man, a voodoo priest and an old friend of John Cassavetes.<p>

                            <p>
                                Oh, and a dwarf. Of course, a goddamn diabolical dwarf with a warty penis!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The list could go on, and it does — somewhere in the back of my head, now a permanent inmate of L’ Hotel du Frisson.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I loved this book, and would read it again in a second. If I do, I’ll make sure to put on Yma Sumac and prepare a two-foot-tall Martini.

                                Lost and Found was a “found newspaper headline” exercise that somehow ended up a story about a top-secret sex toy of mammoth proportions stolen from Vladimir Putin by Donald Trump. It appeared in the New Paper Project in December 2016.&#32;<a href="/assets/pdfs/lost_and_found.pdf">Here’s a PDF version</a> courtesy of Omiros Panagides.

                                I hear this short and very filthy tale was written to be submitted to a lowlife crime editor as a joke. That may or may not be true.

                            <p>
                                I know for a fact it was partly inspired by a YouTube video of an unwholesome paraphilia hitherto unknown to the author.
